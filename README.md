# Project 3: Flixster Part 2
Flixster with added networking capabilites

Submitted by: Samyutha Potharaju

Flixster2 is an app that introduces networking to the Flixster Movie browsing app 

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)
- [x] App has a collection view with the same list of movies
- [x] Uses a tab bar controller to switch between collection view and table view screens
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Make an additional network call to another end-point.	
- [ ] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I could improve app functionality by adding a swipe feature to go from one collection view cell to another

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Some challenges I faced during this project was getting the collection view cells to align correctly on the collection view. To improve the UI I would space the detail view better and allow users to scroll when items go off the screen.
